# Beef Stroganoff Recipe

This shit will fill your fridge and scales well, double/triple this and your future "wtf do I eat today" will thank you

## Ingredients

### For da base

1. 1 POUND ground shmeat
   1. Can also do this with small cubes of whatever beef, just be sure if it's cheap and tough to tenderize it (beat that shit)
   2. Cut along the grain when cubing, small pieces are best, and you can remove the beef if you're in a rush when cooking the pasta to prevent it from getting tough
   3. FUN FACT: boiling beef will make it tough as shit, simmering it will not, but that balance is tough if you're new to cooking and temp control
2. 1 large onion
3. 8oz baby bella mushrooms, cut into quarters
   1. I leave them whole bc I love mushrooms but for sanity reasons if you haven't had stroganoff and/or don't love mushrooms you should be... reasonable
4. 2 tbsp butter/whatever fat you enjoy
   1. FUN FACT: Bacon/Beef fat wins every time, I always keep some rendered fat in my fridge when I have fatty pieces of stuff I trim up for Macy

### inb4 water

1. 2 tbsp soy sauce
2. 2 tbsp worcestershire (more to taste cuz that shit be gooooood)
3. salt pepper garlic powder to desired saltiness/pepperiness/garlickosity
4. 1 tsp dried thyme

### mfw water

1. 10oz pasta du jour (egg noodles are based tho)
   1. just kinda slightly less dry-pasta-to-meat ratio, as the noodles will gain size and weight when cooked
   2. this is also highly personal preference, I just like an even stuff-to-noodle ratio, add more pasta if you like more pasta!!
   3. live ur life fuck boi!!!
2. enough water to cover da pasta
   1. Different for each noodle type, dried vs fresh, roughly 2 cups/pound of dry pasta should be fine
   2. You may have to add liquid/simmer longer to hit the soupy golden ratio you desire
3. Smol amount of beef bouillon, or sub half the water for beef stock, whatever you have on hand+

### after combino

1. 8oz sour cream/full-fat plain greek yogurt
2. half a lemon's worth of lemon juice
   1. kno ur worth, lemon-chan (‚ùÅ¬¥‚ó°`‚ùÅ)
3. chopped FLAT LEAF parsley is fine, sprinkle of FRESH thyme is best
   1. Eastern Europeans are either fond or fuckin JADED about fresh parsley, i like it bc I grew up with it
   2. DO NOT EXPECT THE CURLED-LEAF PARSLEY TO TASTE GOOD, IT DOESN'T
   3. I'M NOT FUCKING AROUND WITH THIS ONE, FLAT LEAF IS SUCH A HUGE BOOST
4. Salt/Pepper to taste

## she instruct on my ion till I... ü§Ø

1. Take a large pot over medium heat, let it come to temperature, then add in your fat & mushrooms first
2. Saute until water leaves mushrooms and it actually browns a bit
3. Add in beef and do the same
4. Add onions afterwards to prevent burning (onions take the least time to cook here of the 3), cook until soft and golden
5. Add the inb4 water ingredients and mix/saute for another minute to combine, taste for seasoning NOW and remember once the pasta and water gets added things will mellow out
6. AS PER THE FUN FACT: if you're not loving temp control, remove the stuff into a bowl to the side
7. Add in the mfw water section, bring to a boil (or a simmer if you're fucking SEASONED), and cook the pasta to your doneness satisfaction level
8. add in da solids if you took them out, fuck boi!!!
   1. you have now achieved combino
9. it is now combino, so add the after combino section
